# css-ui-snippets
A collection of UI pieces made purely in HTML and CSS.

Planned to include:
- Buttons with Icons
- ✅ Links with Icons
- Icon Checkboxes
- Icon Radio Buttons
- ✅ Toggle Switches (with and without labels)
- Progress Bar

Note: For CSS tooltips, see my [CSS Tooltip Template repo](https://github.com/samharp/css-tooltip-template).

Other UI ELements that I would like to build out/have available later that would require a bit of Javascript (and not just HTML and CSS):
- Dropdown Buttons
- Accordions
- Side Panels/Drawers
- Hamburger Menus
